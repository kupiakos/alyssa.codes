I'm Alyssa Haroldsen, a.k.a. `kupiakos`. I'm known for my passion in Rust, inspired by my
volatile relationship with C and C++.
I enjoy making code better and more fun to work with, with a focus on
security, soundness, and maintainability.
For all I love sound code, I especially love hacking&mdash;completely destroying a system's
design to make it do something cursed is one of life's greatest joys.

These days I'm working on embedded Rust at Google, aiming to make code small and panic-free
while remaining as safe as possible.
